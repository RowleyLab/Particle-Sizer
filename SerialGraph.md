SerialGraph
===========

SerialGraph is the user interface software. It was written using the excellent Processing development platform, found at [processing.org/](https://processing.org/)

Note that the SerialGraph application must be run from within the Processing IDE, which is available for free cross-platform at the link above. The application SerialGraph.pde also requires some supporting files and folders, so they are all given below as a compressed archive.

Download the firmware: [SerialGraph.zip](https://github.com/RowleyLab/Particle-Sizer/raw/master/SerialGraph/SerialGraph.zip)
